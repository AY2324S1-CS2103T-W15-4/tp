## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* not used to the university environment
* feels overwhelmed by courses, CCAs and other school things
* wants to connect with seniors & peers to discuss about school work
* wants to connect with like-minded individuals with similar interests
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: easily search and connect with like-minded students amongst the large cohort of Computer Science students in NUS, based on different categories.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `CodeSphere` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

**Use case: Add additional details to your own profile**

**MSS**

1.  User navigates to their profile
2.  CodeSphere shows all existing details
3.  User adds additional details for some categories in their profile page
4.  User saves the new details
5. CodeSphere saves the profile with new details
6. CodeSphere shows the updated profile page

    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. All categories have already been filled up.

    * 2a1. CodeSphere prompts user to edit existing information.
    * 2a2. User edits existing details.</br>
      Use case resumes at step 4.


* 3a. CodeSphere detects incorrect input format for details.

    * 3a1. CodeSphere prompts user to enter details in the correct format.
    * 3a2. User enters details again.

      Use case resumes at step 4.

**Use case:  Delete a profile**

**Preconditions**: User has an existing profile

**MSS**

1. User navigates to their profile.
2. CodeSphere shows the profile page.
3. User chooses to delete their entire profile.
4. CodeSphere prompts the user to confirm the deletion.
5. User confirms the deletion.
6. CodeSphere deletes the user profile.

   Use case ends.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  The application should be able to handle an increasing number of profiles and users without a significant degradation in performance.
3.  The application should gracefully handle errors, providing informative error messages to users in case of failures.
4.  Code should be organized into reusable and maintainable modules, making it easier to enhance and extend the application in the future.
5.  Maintain comprehensive documentation for developers.
6.  The application should run smoothly on different operating systems commonly used by the target users.
7.  Ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate profile information.
