### Project: CodeSphere

**CodeSphere** is a **desktop contact management app, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It is an app targeted at enabling Teaching Assistants in NUS School of Computing to better manage their students.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: AddCourse Command
    * What it does: allows users to add a new course to the home page.
    * Justification: our app is intended for target users, Teaching Assistants, to be able to better manage the classes that they teach. Hence, there is a need for users to add the courses they teach into the app. 
    * Highlights: this enhancement affected the existing Model and Storage components. Implementation required clear understanding of the synergy between components and thus changes accordingly. 

* **New Feature**: EditCourse Command
  * What it does: allows users to edit an existing course on the home page.
  * Justification: in the case where the user has a change in detail they wish to make to an existing course, this is the command to use.
  * Highlights: this enhancement had to be implemented carefully to align with the updated Model component of the app.

* **New Feature**: DeleteCourse Command
  * What it does: allows users to delete an existing course on the home page.
  * Justification: in the case where the user wishes to delete an existing course, this is the command to use.
  * Highlights: this enhancement had to be implemented carefully to align with the updated Model component of the app.

* **New Feature**: Select Command
  * What it does: allows users to select a course to view into, changing the screen to the course view.
  * Justification: each course contains a list of students and to view into it to manage them, the user has to be able to select into one.
  * Highlights: as our app was updated to rely on two stages, Home and Course, this enhancement had to be properly implemented to switch correctly.
